# 👋 Hi, I'm Purnika Khanal

**Computer Engineering '27 | IoT Researcher | Internet Governance Advocate**  
*Building technology that bridges gaps and saves lives*

## 🚨 What I'm Building

Currently developing an **IoT-powered disaster management system** that detects earthquakes, floods, and fires in real-time, automatically dispatching emergency calls to relevant stations (fire brigades, rescue services) and pre-configured contacts. The system features:
- Multi-sensor integration for comprehensive disaster detection
- Intelligent 10-second disable override for false alarms
- Voice-activated emergency bypass (detects keywords like "help")
- Smart call routing to appropriate emergency services

**Impact**: Designed for rapid deployment in disaster-prone regions, particularly targeting communities with limited emergency infrastructure.

## 🔬 Research & Advocacy

**NextGen@ICANN Participant** (ICANN 85) | Exploring the intersection of technology and digital inclusion

**Current Research Focus:**
- 📝 *"Role of Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) in Promoting Linguistic Inclusivity on the Internet"* (Paper under review)
- 🌐 Internet governance and policy frameworks for universal access
- 🤖 Convergence of IoT, AI, and 5G for smart rural connectivity solutions
- 🧠 Natural Language Processing and neural network architectures

**Future Research Vision:** Developing intelligent sensor networks that leverage 5G and edge computing to bring reliable internet access to underserved rural communities, particularly in mountainous regions of Nepal and similar geographies.
